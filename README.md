# Overview

I am hoping to get further experience with display applications, so I know how to do things outside of use from the terminal and html.

I wrote a software that produces an application for drawing shapes, lines, and a vectorized picture.

I wrote this software in order to understand the drawing of different images in a display.

# Development Environment

I used classes in order to implement a compilation of the java code.

Java: javax, awt, io, util.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Apply a fill class in order to fill an area with one color.
- Add in more colors for the image to load.
- Make a shape function, so the toolbar shows shape and the different shape options only show after that.
